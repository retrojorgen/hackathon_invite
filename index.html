          <h3>3. The competition</h3>
          <p>
            This years competition does not enforce any strict rules. We want you to gather in groups of 3-4 people,
            and make something awesome. It can be anything, but it must be presentable by 16:00 on Friday, June, 7th.
            We will of course be expecting you to be curious about new technology, methods and frameworks.
            <br><br>
            We will not be handing out the trophy this year. The trophy is hereby extinct.
            A proper prize will be announced, but the prize is not really important. The important this is to
            build something together, and have fun.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Food and drinks</h3>
          <p>When we get there, a buffee will be waiting for us, and a lunch will be served later on.
          In the evening we will order pizzas, and soft drinks will be available. It will also be possible
          to enjoy a beer if you enjoy thise kind of things :)</p>
          <h3>5. Indian teams</h3>
          <p>We want you to be a part of this! As you know Milo will be in Norway for the event, so we will ask him
            to help organize your teams. You may of course participate on the same terms as the Norwegian teams :)
            Even if you do not want to participate in the competition, we invite you to watch the hackathon with us!
            We aim to have a screen where we can project a webcam of the Hackathon at your offices in India, and we will supply you with a video feed from the Hackathon in Norway.<br><br>
            Remember that this event is not about prestige, it is about having fun. We just want the participants
            to have fun and create something together :)

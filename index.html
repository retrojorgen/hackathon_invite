          <p>
            Welcome, to the June Hackathon extravaganza! To make sure this Hackathon
            will become slightly more awesome than previous years, we have made some changes
            to the Hackathon formula.

              <li>We are not going arrange the Hackathon at the office, this years event will be held at an remote location. We need to get away from the office to hack properly!</li> 
              <li>The competition rules will not be as strict as previous years, the object is to have fun!</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <h3>2. Signing up!</h3>
          <p>
            Of course you are wondering where you can sign up for this magnificent celebration of bad code.
            It is quite easy! send an e-mail to either Chris or Jorgen, marked "Hackathon" in the subject field. Please specify if you want a hotel room for the night,
            and who you plan to share this room with. More details about accommodations this in the next section.
            Please do not hesitate to come talk to us or e-mail if you have any questions at all, there are probably
            several things we have not though of.<br><br>
            You can also visit the irc-channel #hackathon for questions. I suggest every single one of you join this channel right now.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Where, when and how.</h3>
          <p>
            This years event will be held from the 6.-7., June, at <a href="http://www.rosenholmcampus.no/">Rosenholm Campus</a>, at Kolbotn (10-20 mins with taxi, bus or train from Oslo Central Station).<br><br>
            Anyone who wants to join, can do so, does not matter if you are from hosting, product, development, marketing og release. As long as you want to participate in the competition you are qualified! <br> For those of you that want to sleep during the night, we offer an overnight stay at Quality Hotel Mastemyr. Please let us know if you want a hotel room. It is free of charge, but you need to find a room mate to bunk with.<br><br>
            We will be setting up two maxi taxis from the office, leaving at 09:10 AM og June 6th. We will meet at 9 AM to do a people-count and hand out details.
          </p>
          <h3>4. The competition</h3>
          <p>
            This years competition does not enforce any strict rules. We want you to gather in groups of 3-4 people,
            and make something awesome. It can be anything, but it must be presentable by 16:00 on Friday, June, 7th.
            We will of course be expecting you to be curious about new technology, methods and frameworks.
            <br><br>
            We will not be handing out the trophy this year. The trophy is hereby extinct.
            A proper prize will be announced, but the prize is not really important. The important this is to
            build something together, and have fun.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Food and drinks</h3>
          <p>When we get there, a buffet will be waiting for us, and a lunch will be served later on.
          In the evening we will order pizzas, and soft drinks will be available. It will also be possible
          to enjoy a beer if you enjoy thise kind of things :)</p>
          <h3>6. Indian teams</h3>
          <p>We want you to be a part of this! As you know Milo will be in Norway for the event, so we will ask him
            to help organize your teams. You may of course participate on the same terms as the Norwegian teams :)
            Even if you do not want to participate in the competition, we invite you to watch the hackathon with us!
            We aim to have a screen where we can project a webcam of the Hackathon at your offices in India, and we will supply you with a video feed from the Hackathon in Norway.<br><br>
            Remember that this event is not about prestige, it is about having fun. We just want the participants
            to have fun and create something together :)
